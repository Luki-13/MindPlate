MindPlate is Intelectual Property of Lucas Sant'ana Ferrarese

The game consists of memorizing a car plate and typing it after 3 seconds, if the player guesses the plate correctly he wins a certain ammount of points. The game has a simple score sistem that can provide a competition between two players. 
It was inspired in a story about the legendary chess player Emory Tate Jr., which used to memorize all the car plates that he saw with frequence, so that he could be sure that no one was following him. This game was created with the purpose of trying to train memorizing car plates.

Memorizing car plates can be useful in a handful of sittuations, if a car hits you and you don't have enough time to take a photo of it, if you wan't to make sure if your workers are coming to work in the right time (Bill Gates used to do this) or if you just wan't to improve your memory.

Have fun! (make sure to run it in .pyw)
